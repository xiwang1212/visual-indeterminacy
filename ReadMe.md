### Citation 

If you use the data or the code, please consider citing the following paper.

## Setup

* Install dependencies using pip/anaconda/etc, if needed: Streamlit, ...
They can also be installed by 
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* Download image set from [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jKCcRIECSJSLO6M7GYGJyukKetpGh-Ox/view?usp=sharing) and unzip in main folder
* Optionally, download precomputed histograms from 
[link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EnI10uc3UlagtTtx4DLIVaBEmoJkQMe7/view?usp=sharing), otherwise these will be recomputed the first time you run the code.

### Check it online
You can also cehck out this [online application](https://obscure-crag-12967.herokuapp.com/).

### Interface
You can change selections in the sidebar on the left to see different visualizations.

* `Image Category`: select "All" to see all the images.

- `Display mode`: a drop-down menu with the following four options. 
    - `Single image`: shows details of each image in the selected category.     
        - `Show descriptions`: prints out all raw descriptions gathered from participants.
        - `Show descriptions table`: shows a table view of how descriptions are parsed to nouns, from which synonyms are further grouped together.
        - `Plot histograms of nouns`: By default, histograms of nouns from descriptions in both viewing condition (0.5s and 3s) is plotted.                
    - `First N images`: shows the first N images from the selected category.
    - `Scatterplot`: `X axis` and `Y axis` can be selected from the drop-down menus.  
    Fig. 6 in the published paper can viewed by selecting `H_3000` for `X axis` and `H_500` for `Y axis`.
    Mouseover a dot to see the name of that image.
    - `Sorted images`: displays images sorted by different metrics, including entropy from both viewing conditions,
     entropy difference, and entropy from 3s viewing.
